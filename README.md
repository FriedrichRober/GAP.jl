The GAP 4 package `JuliaInterface'
==================================





# Notes for Mac OS X

It is possible to link JuliaInterface against the official Julia binary
which one can download from <https://julialang.org/downloads/>.
To do so, run configure as follows:

  ./configure --with-julia=/PATH/TO/Julia*.app/Contents/Resources/julia
