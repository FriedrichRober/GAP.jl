OSCAR - LibGAP
--------------

This is some prototype code that uses a version of LibGAP
(for example as currently to be fond [[https://github.com/gap-system/gap/pull/1205]](here))a to be able to call GAP functions from Julia.

Please don't use for any production code just yet, but do use it for prototyping and let me know what's wrong with it.
