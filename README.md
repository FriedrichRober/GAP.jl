OSCAR - LibGAP
--------------

This is some prototype code that uses a version of GAP as a library,
for example as currently to be found at https://github.com/gap-system/gap/pull/1205
to be able to call GAP functions from Julia.

Please don't use for any production code just yet, but do use it for
prototyping and let me know what's wrong with it.

(Documentation on how to use it to follow)
